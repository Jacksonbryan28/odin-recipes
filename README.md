# odin-recipes

Hello!

This project is part of The Odin Projects (TOP) foundations course. This is the first project called "odin-recipes" which will use my new knowledge of HTML to create a recipe page.

After this I hope to create recpies using HTML and HTML tags I have learned while also linking different pages together.
